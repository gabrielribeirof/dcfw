## About

:warning: Under development

DSFW is intended to be a framework to efficiently interact with the Discord API and assist in the creation of **Bots**, **Commands (Slash, User and Message)** and other Discord API resources. It will be built with Typescript and will combine elements of Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming.

DSFW will provide an out-of-the-box application architecture that allows building efficient, testable, and scalable applications. Heavily inspired by Nest and Angular.
